# Directory Rename Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Identified the Issue**:

   - The directory path `C:\Shahern004 Github\CRUSTy-Core` with a space was causing build issues
   - This was particularly problematic with the Zephyr build system and device tree processing

2. **Created Solutions**:
   - Provided step-by-step instructions for renaming the directory to `C:\shahern004_github\CRUSTy-Core`
   - Created a cleanup script (`cleanup_after_rename.ps1`) to clear cached paths after the rename
   - Prepared a testing guide (`test_uart_after_rename.md`) for validating the UART integration

## Next Steps

1. **Perform the Rename**:

   - Close VSCode completely
   - Rename the directory from Windows Explorer
   - Re-open the project from the new location

2. **Run the Cleanup Script**:

   - Execute `.\cleanup_after_rename.ps1` from PowerShell in the project directory
   - This will clean caches and build directories

3. **Rebuild and Test**:
   - Follow the instructions in `test_uart_after_rename.md`
   - Build the project with `west build -b stm32h573i_dk -p`
   - Test the UART integration as described

## Expected Outcomes

After completing these steps:

1. Build errors related to paths with spaces should be resolved
2. The device tree overlay should process correctly
3. The UART integration should function as expected
4. VSCode should properly recognize include paths again

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after the rename:

1. Check for any remaining references to the old path in configuration files
2. Ensure VSCode's C/C++ extension has properly refreshed its include paths
3. Try restarting VSCode completely if include errors persist
4. Make sure the Zephyr environment variables are updated if necessary

The directory rename addresses the root cause of the build failures we were experiencing, particularly with the device tree preprocessing that was failing due to spaces in the path.
