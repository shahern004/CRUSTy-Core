# CRUSTy-Core Security Implementation

This document details the security implementation of CRUSTy-Core, including memory safety, input validation, error handling, and compiler hardening.

## Memory Safety Implementation

- **Rust for Security-Critical Operations**

  - All cryptographic operations are implemented in Rust
  - Rust's ownership model prevents memory safety issues
  - No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or data races

- **Secure Memory Handling in C++**
  - SecureData template with automatic memory wiping
  - Smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) for resource management
  - RAII patterns to ensure proper cleanup
  - Bounds checking for all array and buffer operations
  - Avoiding raw pointers and manual memory management

## Input Validation

- **Path Sanitization**

  - Prevention of directory traversal attacks
  - Validation of file paths before operations

- **Comprehensive Validation**
  - All inputs validated at trust boundaries
  - Allowlist validation rather than blocklists
  - Consistent validation across all entry points
  - Validation failures result in secure error states

## Error Handling

- **Comprehensive Exception Handling**

  - All predictable exceptions identified and handled
  - Error messages don't disclose sensitive information
  - Graceful degradation in case of errors
  - Secure default states on failure

- **Logging**
  - Comprehensive logging of security-relevant errors
  - Thread-safe audit logging system

## Compiler Hardening

- **Stack Protection**

  - Stack protection mechanisms to prevent buffer overflow attacks

- **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**

  - Increased memory access security

- **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)**

  - Prevention of code execution from data pages

- **Control Flow Guard**

  - Prevention of hijacking program control flow

- **Position Independent Executable (PIE)**
  - Enhanced security through position independence

## Cryptographic Implementation

- **AES-256-GCM**

  - Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
  - Protection against tampering and replay attacks

- **Nonce Management**

  - Each file encrypted with a unique nonce
  - Prevention of reuse vulnerabilities

- **Key Derivation**
  - Argon2id for password-based key derivation
  - Configurable memory and CPU cost parameters

## Security Considerations

- CRUSTy-Core uses strong encryption algorithms, but has not been formally audited
- For highly sensitive data, consider using established encryption tools
- This is an educational proof-of-concept, not intended for critical file encryption
