# Migrating from Pure C++ to a Hybrid Rust Architecture

## Introduction

This guide provides a structured approach to integrate Rust into an existing C++ codebase within a single binary. Rather than a complete rewrite, this guide focuses on incremental migration while maintaining system stability and performance. 
A helpful Rust dual-implementation resource is The Embedded Rust Book at: https://docs.rust-embedded.org

## Why Consider a Hybrid Architecture?

- **Memory Safety**: Utilizing Rust's ownership model for memory-sensitive operations
- **Performance**: Maintaining C++'s performance for computationally intensive tasks
- **Gradual Adoption**: Allowing for incremental migration without system-wide disruption
- **Modern Tooling**: Access to Rust's ecosystem while preserving existing C++ investments
- **Security**: Enhanced security posture without complete system redesign

## Pre-Migration Planning

### 1. FFI Strategy

Determine how your Rust and C++ components will communicate:

1. **Define Interface Boundaries**:
   - Identify clear boundary points with minimal data transfer
   - Design for coarse-grained rather than fine-grained interactions
   - Consider serialization formats for complex data structures
2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Define error propagation across language boundaries
   - Establish error mapping between Rust's Result/Option types and C++ error mechanisms
3. **Memory Ownership Rules**:
   - Clearly define which language owns memory at each boundary crossing
   - Document lifetime guarantees and restrictions
   - Establish buffer management protocols

### 2. Create a Build System Integration Plan

   **Development Environment Setup**:
   - Install Rust toolchain alongside C++ toolchain
   - Configure IDE support for both languages
   - Create build scripts that handle both languages

## Phased Migration Approach

### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Tooling

1. **Setup the Rust Environment**:
   - Install the Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)
   - Configure cargo workspace structure
   - Create initial crate(s) for the project
   - Implement build system integration (e.g., using Corrosion for CMake)

2. **Create FFI Foundation**:
   - Implement basic FFI utilities
   - Create C-compatible header generation (using cbindgen)
   - Establish memory management patterns across the boundary
   - Create error mapping utilities between languages

3. **Implement Continuous Integration**:
   - Configure CI to build and test both C++ and Rust
   - Create integration tests that verify FFI boundary integrity
   - Implement automated testing for the hybrid system

### Phase 2: Initial Component Migration

1. **Pilot Component Selection**:
   - Choose a non-critical, relatively isolated component
   - Ideally select functionality around Rust's strengths (memory safety, concurrency)
   - Ensure the component has well-defined interfaces

2. **Shadow Implementation**:
   - Implement the component in Rust alongside the existing C++ implementation
   - Create FFI bindings that follow your established patterns
   - Maintain both implementations during the transition period

### Phase 3: Expand Migration Scope

   **Interface Refinement**:
   - Refine FFI boundaries
   - Optimize data transfer between languages

### Phase 4: Critical System Migration

1. **Risk Mitigation for Critical Components**:
   - Comprehensive monitoring before migration
   - Create rollback plans

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile the hybrid system to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize FFI boundary crossings
   - Consider redesigning data structures for better cross-language efficiency

## Migration Patterns and Best Practices


### Parallel Implementation Pattern

For critical systems where direct replacement is too risky:

1. **Implement in Parallel**:
   - Create the Rust implementation alongside the C++ version
   - Process the same inputs through both paths
   - Compare outputs but use only the C++ result in production

2. **Shadowing Period**:
   - Run both implementations in production but only use C++ results
   - Log and analyze differences between implementations
   - Fix discrepancies in the Rust version

3. **Gradual Cutover**:
   - Begin using Rust results for a small percentage of traffic
   - Gradually increase the percentage
   - Maintain the ability to fall back to C++ instantly

4. **Complete Migration**:
   - Once Rust handles 100% of traffic successfully, remove C++ implementation
   - Continue monitoring for any unexpected behavior

### Feature Toggle Design

Implement feature toggles to control the migration process:

1. **Toggle Granularity**:
   - Create toggles at appropriate component boundaries
   - Consider both coarse and fine-grained toggles for flexibility

2. **Toggle Control**:
   - Implement runtime control for critical systems
   - Consider both global and per-request toggling mechanisms

3. **Monitoring Integration**:
   - Tie toggle state to monitoring systems
   - Track performance and correctness metrics per toggle state

4. **Fallback Automation**:
   - Implement automatic fallback based on error rates or performance
   - Create circuit breakers that can disable Rust components if necessary

## Testing Strategies

### Integration Testing Across Boundaries

1. **Boundary Validation**:
   - Test data marshalling across FFI boundaries
   - Verify error propagation works as expected
   - Test edge cases and malformed inputs

2. **Fault Injection**:
   - Test how errors in Rust components affect the broader C++ system
   - Verify that resource cleanup works properly across language boundaries
   - Test recovery mechanisms under failure conditions

### Security Testing

1. **Memory Safety Verification**:
   - Verify that Rust's memory safety benefits are preserved across FFI
   - Test for memory leaks at language boundaries
   - Verify proper handling of unsafe code blocks

2. **Fuzzing**

3. **Static Analysis**

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Build System Integration

**Challenge**: Integrating Rust into C++ build systems can be complex, especially with legacy build configurations.

**Solutions**:
- Use tools like Corrosion for CMake integration
- Create wrapper scripts that handle both languages
- Establish clear conventions for build artifacts
- Document build procedures thoroughly

### FFI Overhead

**Challenge**: Frequent crossing of language boundaries can introduce performance overhead.

**Solutions**:
- Design coarse-grained interfaces to minimize crossings
- Batch operations where possible
- Use zero-copy techniques when appropriate
- Profile and optimize critical boundary crossings

### Error Handling Differences

**Challenge**: Rust's Result/Option paradigm differs from typical C++ error handling.

**Solutions**:
- Create consistent error mapping between languages
- Establish clear patterns for error propagation
- Document error handling expectations for each component
- Implement robust logging across boundaries

### Team Expertise

**Challenge**: Most C++ teams lack Rust expertise initially.

**Solutions**:
- Provide structured training for C++ developers
- Start with small, isolated components to build experience
- Pair program across language boundaries
- Create coding standards and review guidelines for Rust code

### Debugging Across Languages

**Challenge**: Debugging issues that cross language boundaries can be difficult.

**Solutions**:
- Implement detailed logging at FFI boundaries
- Create tools to trace execution across languages
- Establish consistent error codes and messages
- Use debug builds with additional validation
