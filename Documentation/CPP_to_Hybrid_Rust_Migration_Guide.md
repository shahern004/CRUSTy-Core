# Migrating from Pure C++ to a Hybrid Rust Architecture

## Introduction

This guide provides a structured approach to integrate Rust into an existing C++ codebase within a single binary. Rather than a complete rewrite, this guide focuses on incremental migration while maintaining system stability and performance.

## Why Consider a Hybrid Architecture?

- **Memory Safety**: Utilizing Rust's ownership model for memory-sensitive operations
- **Performance**: Maintaining C++'s performance for computationally intensive tasks
- **Gradual Adoption**: Allowing for incremental migration without system-wide disruption
- **Modern Tooling**: Access to Rust's ecosystem while preserving existing C++ investments
- **Security**: Enhanced security posture without complete system redesign

## Pre-Migration Planning

### 1. System Component Analysis

Before starting the migration, thoroughly analyze your existing C++ system:

1. **Component Mapping**: Document all major components, their responsibilities, and dependencies
2. **Risk Assessment**: Identify components with:
   - Highest memory safety concerns
   - Most critical security requirements
   - Performance-critical sections
   - Complex dependency chains
3. **Migration Prioritization**: Create a prioritized list of components for migration, considering:
   - Security benefit from Rust's memory safety
   - Isolation level (components with fewer dependencies are easier to migrate)
   - Business criticality (less critical components are safer for initial migration attempts)

### 2. FFI Strategy

Determine how your Rust and C++ components will communicate:

1. **Define Interface Boundaries**:
   - Identify clear boundary points with minimal data transfer
   - Design for coarse-grained rather than fine-grained interactions
   - Consider serialization formats for complex data structures
2. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Define error propagation across language boundaries
   - Establish error mapping between Rust's Result/Option types and C++ error mechanisms
3. **Memory Ownership Rules**:
   - Clearly define which language owns memory at each boundary crossing
   - Document lifetime guarantees and restrictions
   - Establish buffer management protocols

### 3. Create a Build System Integration Plan

1. **Development Environment Setup**:
   - Install Rust toolchain alongside C++ toolchain
   - Configure IDE support for both languages
   - Create build scripts that handle both languages
2. **Continuous Integration Planning**:
   - Update CI pipelines to build and test both languages
   - Establish automated integration testing across language boundaries
3. **Documentation**:
   - Document build procedures for the hybrid system
   - Create onboarding guides for developers new to either language

## Phased Migration Approach

### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Tooling

1. **Setup the Rust Environment**:
   - Install the Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)
   - Configure cargo workspace structure
   - Create initial crate(s) for the project
   - Implement build system integration (e.g., using Corrosion for CMake)
2. **Create FFI Foundation**:

   - Implement basic FFI utilities
   - Create C-compatible header generation (using cbindgen)
   - Establish memory management patterns across the boundary
   - Create error mapping utilities between languages

3. **Implement Continuous Integration**:
   - Configure CI to build and test both C++ and Rust
   - Create integration tests that verify FFI boundary integrity
   - Implement automated testing for the hybrid system

### Phase 2: Initial Component Migration

1. **Pilot Component Selection**:

   - Choose a non-critical, relatively isolated component
   - Ideally select functionality where Rust's strengths (memory safety, concurrency) provide clear benefits
   - Ensure the component has well-defined interfaces

2. **Shadow Implementation**:

   - Implement the component in Rust alongside the existing C++ implementation
   - Create FFI bindings that follow your established patterns
   - Maintain both implementations during the transition period

3. **Testing Strategy**:

   - Create comprehensive tests for both implementations
   - Implement A/B testing capabilities to compare outputs
   - Configure logging for performance comparison

4. **Controlled Deployment**:
   - Implement feature toggles to control which implementation is used
   - Deploy with the ability to quickly rollback if issues arise

### Phase 3: Expand Migration Scope

1. **Incremental Component Migration**:

   - Based on lessons learned, select the next set of components
   - Prioritize components that interact with already-migrated parts

2. **Interface Refinement**:

   - Refine FFI boundaries
   - Optimize data transfer between languages

3. **Progressive Testing Expansion**:

   - Expand test coverage across language boundaries
   - Implement performance benchmarking

### Phase 4: Critical System Migration

1. **Risk Mitigation for Critical Components**:

   - Comprehensive monitoring before migration
   - Create rollback plans

2. **Gradual Replacement Strategy**:

   - Maintain backward compatibility throughout the process
   - Implement thorough integration testing at each step

3. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Profile the hybrid system to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize FFI boundary crossings
   - Consider redesigning data structures for better cross-language efficiency

4. **User Impact Monitoring**:
   - Implement detailed telemetry for user-facing changes
   - Establish clear metrics for migration success

## Migration Patterns and Best Practices

### The Strangler Pattern

1. **Create Facade**:

   - Implement a facade over the existing C++ component
   - Ensure all access goes through this facade

2. **Implement in Rust**:

   - Create the Rust implementation of the component
   - Expose it through your FFI boundary

3. **Gradual Transition**:

   - Incrementally route requests from the facade to the Rust implementation
   - Use feature flags to control the routing
   - Monitor and compare results during the transition

4. **Complete Replacement**:
   - Once stable, remove the old C++ implementation
   - Simplify the facade or replace it entirely with direct Rust calls

### Parallel Implementation Pattern

For critical systems where direct replacement is too risky:

1. **Implement in Parallel**:

   - Create the Rust implementation alongside the C++ version
   - Process the same inputs through both paths
   - Compare outputs but use only the C++ result in production

2. **Shadowing Period**:

   - Run both implementations in production but only use C++ results
   - Log and analyze differences between implementations
   - Fix discrepancies in the Rust version

3. **Gradual Cutover**:

   - Begin using Rust results for a small percentage of traffic
   - Gradually increase the percentage
   - Maintain the ability to fall back to C++ instantly

4. **Complete Migration**:
   - Once Rust handles 100% of traffic successfully, remove C++ implementation
   - Continue monitoring for any unexpected behavior

### Feature Toggle Design

Implement feature toggles to control the migration process:

1. **Toggle Granularity**:

   - Create toggles at appropriate component boundaries
   - Consider both coarse and fine-grained toggles for flexibility

2. **Toggle Control**:

   - Implement runtime control for critical systems
   - Consider both global and per-request toggling mechanisms

3. **Monitoring Integration**:

   - Tie toggle state to monitoring systems
   - Track performance and correctness metrics per toggle state

4. **Fallback Automation**:
   - Implement automatic fallback based on error rates or performance
   - Create circuit breakers that can disable Rust components if necessary

## Testing Strategies

### Integration Testing Across Boundaries

1. **Boundary Validation**:

   - Test data marshalling across FFI boundaries
   - Verify error propagation works as expected
   - Test edge cases and malformed inputs

2. **Parity Testing**:

   - Create tests that verify both implementations produce identical results
   - Include performance benchmarks in automated tests
   - Test with production-like data volumes

3. **Fault Injection**:
   - Test how errors in Rust components affect the broader C++ system
   - Verify that resource cleanup works properly across language boundaries
   - Test recovery mechanisms under failure conditions

### Performance Benchmarking

1. **Baseline Establishment**:

   - Establish performance baselines for C++ components before migration
   - Document expected performance characteristics

2. **Comparative Analysis**:

   - Compare performance between C++ and Rust implementations
   - Analyze FFI overhead
   - Identify optimization opportunities

3. **Load Testing**:
   - Perform load testing on hybrid system
   - Verify performance under peak conditions
   - Test memory usage patterns during sustained load

### Security Testing

1. **Memory Safety Verification**:

   - Verify that Rust's memory safety benefits are preserved across FFI
   - Test for memory leaks at language boundaries
   - Verify proper handling of unsafe code blocks

2. **Fuzzing**:

3. **Static Analysis**:
