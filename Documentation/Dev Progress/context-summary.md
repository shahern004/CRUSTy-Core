# Next Task: Hardware Abstraction Layer Implementation

## Task Context (3/8/2025)

### QEMU Emulation Enhancement Progress

We've made significant progress in enhancing the STM32H573I-DK QEMU emulation. After implementing the organic QEMU approach, resolving CPU configuration discrepancies, and improving terminal output visibility, we now have a consistent and reliable environment for QEMU emulation:

- Successfully standardized CPU configuration to consistently use Cortex-M33 across all configuration files and scripts
- Consolidated multiple QEMU scripts into two simplified scripts with built-in logging:
  - `simple-qemu.ps1`: Comprehensive script for QEMU operations
  - `hardware-tool.ps1`: Placeholder script for future hardware operations
- Created a dedicated "logs" folder for consistent log file storage
- Fixed issues with terminal output visibility in Act mode
- Implemented robust error handling and logging in all scripts

The current configuration includes:

- A basic Zephyr application that can run in QEMU
- Simplified PowerShell scripts for building and running the application
- Consistent configuration using the stm32h573i_dk board target with the mps2-an500 machine
- Proper support for the Cortex-M33 CPU used in the actual STM32H573I-DK hardware
- Reliable logging to ensure output is visible to tools like Cline Claude

With Phase 1 (CPU Configuration Standardization) completed and the terminal output visibility issues resolved, we're now ready to move on to Phase 2: Hardware Abstraction Layer implementation.

## Next Development Phase: Hardware Abstraction Layer

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) will provide a consistent API for accessing hardware peripherals across both QEMU and real hardware environments. This will enable developers to write code that works seamlessly in both environments without requiring significant changes.

### Key Objectives

1. Create a dedicated HAL module with hardware-agnostic API
2. Implement abstractions for GPIO, UART, and other peripherals
3. Support both QEMU and real hardware through the same interface
4. Add runtime detection capabilities where possible

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create HAL Header Files**:

   - Define hardware-agnostic interfaces for GPIO, UART, and other peripherals
   - Create clear abstraction boundaries between application code and hardware-specific code
   - Design API that works consistently across both environments

2. **Implement QEMU-Specific HAL**:

   - Create implementations of the HAL interfaces for the QEMU environment
   - Use Zephyr's device drivers and APIs to access simulated hardware
   - Add QEMU-specific optimizations and workarounds

3. **Implement STM32H573I-DK-Specific HAL**:

   - Create implementations of the HAL interfaces for the real hardware
   - Use STM32CubeH5 HAL or Zephyr's STM32 drivers to access hardware
   - Ensure compatibility with the QEMU implementation

4. **Add Runtime Detection**:
   - Implement mechanisms to detect the current environment (QEMU vs real hardware)
   - Create factory functions to instantiate the appropriate HAL implementation
   - Add fallback mechanisms for unsupported features

### Implementation Considerations

- Focus on creating a consistent API that works across both environments
- Use conditional compilation (#ifdef QEMU) only when absolutely necessary
- Implement runtime detection of the environment where possible
- Structure the code to allow for easy addition of new peripherals
- Ensure all functionality is thoroughly tested in both environments
- Document any limitations or differences clearly

### Testing Strategy

1. Develop unit tests for each HAL interface
2. Test each implementation (QEMU and real hardware) separately
3. Verify that the same application code works correctly in both environments
4. Document any discrepancies or limitations

This Hardware Abstraction Layer will provide the foundation for the subsequent phases of the QEMU emulation enhancement, enabling more sophisticated application features and ensuring consistent behavior across environments.

## Previous Improvements

### Script Consolidation and Logging Improvements (3/8/2025)

We consolidated multiple QEMU scripts into two simplified scripts with built-in logging:

1. **Created new simplified scripts**:

   - `simple-qemu.ps1`: Comprehensive script for QEMU operations with built-in logging
   - `hardware-tool.ps1`: Placeholder script for future hardware operations with consistent interface

2. **Key improvements**:
   - Created dedicated "logs" folder for consistent log file storage
   - Fixed issues with terminal output visibility in Act mode
   - Implemented robust error handling and logging in all scripts
   - Standardized parameter naming to avoid conflicts
   - Simplified the overall workflow for QEMU operations

### Terminal Output Visibility Workaround (3/8/2025)

We implemented several workarounds to address the issue of terminal outputs not being properly captured and forwarded to Claude:

1. **Command Wrapper Script**:

   - Created `tools/command-wrapper.ps1` to execute commands and capture their output to files

2. **Enhanced Logging**:

   - Implemented direct file logging in all scripts
   - Created timestamped log files for each operation
   - Ensured all command output is captured and stored

3. **Best Practices Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `Documentation/Dev Progress/terminal-output-workaround.md`
   - Documented best practices for working with Cline to avoid terminal output visibility issues

These improvements have established a solid foundation for the ongoing enhancement of the STM32H573I-DK QEMU emulation, enabling more reliable development and testing workflows.
