# Next Task: Documentation Streamlining and QEMU Emulation Enhancement

## Task Context (3/7/2025)

### Documentation Streamlining

We've successfully streamlined the project documentation to enhance workflow and provide better context:

- Created a central Documentation/README.md that serves as a unified documentation index
- Consolidated QEMU documentation into a comprehensive QEMU_Unified_Guide.md
- Created a unified Embedded_Unified_Guide.md that combines STM32H573I-DK migration and embedded integration information
- Implemented development context templates for different types of tasks
- Added documentation status tracking to improve visibility

The new documentation structure provides:

- Better organization by purpose rather than location
- Reduced redundancy across multiple documents
- Enhanced context for development tasks
- Improved onboarding for new developers
- Clearer relationships between different documentation components

### QEMU Emulation Enhancement

We've successfully configured Zephyr QEMU for emulating the STM32H573I-DK application. After encountering several challenges with CPU compatibility, we've implemented a working solution:

- Initially attempted to use the STM32H573I-DK board configuration with QEMU, but encountered issues with CPU_CORTEX_M7 and CPU_CORTEX_M33 configurations
- Discovered that the installed QEMU version has limited support for Cortex-M CPUs (only Cortex-M3 for mps2-an385 and Cortex-M7 for other machines)
- Changed approach to use the qemu_cortex_m3 board target, which is specifically designed for QEMU emulation
- Successfully built and ran the application in QEMU using this approach

The current configuration includes:

- A basic Zephyr application that can run in QEMU
- PowerShell script (run-qemu.ps1) for building and running the application
- Configuration to use the qemu_cortex_m3 board target with the mps2-an385 machine

After analyzing the current implementation, we've identified several areas for improvement and created a detailed plan to enhance the STM32H573I-DK QEMU emulation.

## Development Plan

### Documentation Maintenance

- Continue to update the unified documentation as the project evolves
- Ensure new features and components are properly documented
- Maintain the documentation index to reflect the current state of the project
- Update development context templates as needed

### QEMU Emulation Enhancement

We will enhance the STM32H573I-DK QEMU emulation through the following phases:

#### Phase 1: CPU Configuration Standardization

- Resolve CPU configuration discrepancies between Kconfig.board (CPU_CORTEX_M33) and Kconfig.defconfig (CPU_CORTEX_M7)
- Update board.cmake to use the appropriate CPU type
- Update run-qemu.ps1 to use the correct machine for the selected CPU

#### Phase 2: Hardware Abstraction Layer

- Create a dedicated HAL module with hardware-agnostic API
- Implement abstractions for GPIO, UART, and other peripherals
- Support both QEMU and real hardware through the same interface
- Add runtime detection capabilities where possible

#### Phase 3: Application Enhancement

- Improve console output with detailed logging and visual indicators
- Enhance LED functionality with sophisticated patterns and visual feedback
- Add button input simulation in QEMU
- Implement timer-based demonstrations to showcase functionality

#### Phase 4: Dual-Target Build System

- Enhance the build system for better dual-target support
- Improve conditional compilation structure
- Update run-qemu.ps1 with support for enhanced features
- Create helper scripts for building and testing

#### Phase 5: Documentation

- Document architecture differences between Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M33
- Create a peripheral compatibility chart
- Provide comprehensive testing guidance

## Implementation Considerations

- Focus on creating a consistent API that works across both environments
- Use conditional compilation (#ifdef QEMU) only when absolutely necessary
- Implement runtime detection of the environment where possible
- Structure the code to allow for easy addition of new peripherals
- Ensure all functionality is thoroughly tested in both environments
- Document any limitations or differences clearly

## Testing Strategy

1. For each phase:

   - Implement the changes incrementally
   - Test in QEMU before proceeding
   - Verify on real hardware when possible
   - Document any discrepancies or issues

2. Final validation:
   - Run comprehensive tests in both environments
   - Compare behavior and performance
   - Verify that the same application works correctly in both environments
   - Document any remaining limitations or differences

This enhancement will provide a robust development and testing environment for the STM32H573I-DK, allowing for faster development cycles and more thorough testing without requiring physical hardware for every test.
