# Next Task: Enhance Application with Zephyr STM32 HAL

## Task Context (3/8/2025)

### Zephyr STM32 HAL Integration Progress

We have successfully integrated the Zephyr STM32 HAL into our project:

- Moved the Zephyr base from external location to `tools/zephyr` for a self-contained repository
- Updated build scripts to use the local Zephyr base
- Configured CMakeLists.txt to include STM32 HAL headers
- Enhanced main.c with STM32 HAL integration for direct hardware access
- Added SystemClock_Config for STM32H573I-DK
- Created prj.conf with STM32 HAL configuration options

### Next Development Phase: Application Enhancement with Zephyr HAL

With the Zephyr STM32 HAL now integrated, we should focus on enhancing the application functionality using Zephyr's features.

### Key Objectives

1. Enhance application functionality using Zephyr's features
2. Implement more advanced hardware interactions
3. Improve error handling and robustness
4. Test on both QEMU and real hardware
5. Document usage patterns and examples

### Implementation Plan

1. **Enhance LED Functionality**:

   - Implement more sophisticated LED patterns
   - Use PWM for LED brightness control
   - Create visual indicators for system status
   - Implement demo mode with various LED effects

2. **Improve UART Communication**:

   - Implement command parsing for UART input
   - Add more sophisticated UART output formatting
   - Implement flow control and error handling
   - Create a simple CLI for interacting with the application

3. **Add Sensor Integration**:

   - Implement I2C communication for sensors
   - Add SPI communication for external devices
   - Implement sensor data processing and display
   - Create abstraction layer for sensor access

4. **Implement Timer-Based Features**:

   - Use Zephyr's timer APIs for periodic tasks
   - Implement precise timing for critical operations
   - Create scheduling system for multiple periodic tasks
   - Add power management features

5. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Test all features in both QEMU and hardware environments
   - Document any differences between environments
   - Create usage examples for common peripherals
   - Update existing documentation with new features

### Implementation Considerations

- **Hardware Abstraction**: Continue to use Zephyr's board abstraction to handle hardware differences
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for all hardware interactions
- **Power Management**: Consider power consumption and implement power-saving features
- **Memory Usage**: Optimize memory usage for embedded constraints
- **Code Organization**: Keep code modular and well-organized for maintainability

### Testing Strategy

1. Test all features in QEMU environment first
2. Verify functionality on real hardware
3. Document any discrepancies between environments
4. Create automated tests for critical functionality
5. Implement stress tests for reliability assessment

This enhancement phase will build upon our successful HAL integration to create a more feature-rich and robust application that fully leverages the capabilities of the Zephyr RTOS and STM32 HAL.
