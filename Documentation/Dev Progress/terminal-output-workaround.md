# Terminal Output Visibility Workaround

## Issue Description

When using Cline in Act mode to execute commands, there's an issue where terminal outputs may not be properly captured and forwarded to Claude. This can happen during longer sessions, particularly when running complex commands like QEMU emulation or build processes.

The issue manifests as follows:

- Commands are executed successfully in the VSCode terminal
- Output is visible to the user in the VSCode terminal
- Claude reports not seeing any output or only seeing partial output
- This typically happens in the middle of tasks, not at the beginning

This appears to be a limitation in how the Cline extension captures and forwards terminal output to the Claude AI.

## Workaround Solutions

We've implemented several workarounds to address this issue:

### 1. Command Wrapper Script

A general-purpose command wrapper script has been created at `tools/command-wrapper.ps1`. This script:

- Executes any command you provide
- Captures the command's output to a file
- Optionally displays the output in the console
- Returns the path to the output file

Usage:

```powershell
# Basic usage
.\command-wrapper.ps1 -Command "your-command-here"

# Specify output file and show output in console
.\command-wrapper.ps1 -Command "your-command-here" -OutputFile "output.log" -ShowOutput
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging Scripts

Modified versions of the QEMU scripts have been created with enhanced logging:

- `tools/QEMU Reference/build-app-with-logging.ps1`: Builds the application with output captured to log files
- `tools/QEMU Reference/run-qemu-only-with-logging.ps1`: Runs QEMU with output captured to log files

These scripts:

- Create a timestamped log file for each run
- Log all messages to both the console and the log file
- Use the command wrapper to capture command output
- Store logs in a `logs` directory within the QEMU Reference folder

Usage:

```powershell
# Build with logging
.\build-app-with-logging.ps1

# Run with logging
.\run-qemu-only-with-logging.ps1 -BinaryPath "build\zephyr\zephyr.elf"
```

## Best Practices for Working with Cline

When working with Cline in Act mode, consider these best practices to avoid terminal output visibility issues:

1. **Use the logging scripts**: When running complex commands, use the enhanced logging scripts or the command wrapper.

2. **Redirect output to files**: For any command where the output is important, redirect it to a file:

   ```powershell
   your-command > output.txt 2>&1
   ```

3. **Read output from files**: After running a command, use the `read_file` tool to check the output:

   ```powershell
   # Run command with output redirection
   your-command > output.txt 2>&1

   # Then read the file to see the output
   read_file output.txt
   ```

4. **Use echo commands for status**: Add echo commands to provide status updates that might be more reliably captured:

   ```powershell
   echo "Starting build process..."
   build-command > build.log 2>&1
   echo "Build process completed. Check build.log for details."
   ```

5. **Break long-running tasks into smaller steps**: Instead of one large command, break it into smaller steps with verification points.

## Reporting the Issue

This appears to be a limitation in the Cline extension. Consider reporting this issue to the Cline developers with the following details:

- Cline version: 3.6.3
- Description: Terminal output visible in VSCode is not being forwarded to Claude AI during Act mode
- Pattern: Works initially but fails during longer sessions
- Other relevant extensions: PowerShell, CMake Tools

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to these workarounds could include:

1. Creating a more comprehensive logging framework
2. Implementing automatic output redirection for all scripts
3. Developing a custom terminal that better integrates with Cline
