# NSA Secure Coding Practices

This document outlines key secure coding practices based on NSA guidelines to help developers write more secure code.

## Input Validation

- **Validate All Input**: Treat all input as untrusted. Validate input for type, length, format, and range.
- **Use Whitelisting**: Define what is allowed rather than what is disallowed.
- **Sanitize Data**: Properly encode output to prevent injection attacks.
- **Validate Client-Side and Server-Side**: Never rely solely on client-side validation.

## Authentication and Authorization

- **Implement Proper Session Management**: Use secure, randomly generated session identifiers.
- **Apply Least Privilege Principle**: Grant only the permissions necessary for a user to perform their function.
- **Secure Password Storage**: Use strong, adaptive hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2) with salting.

## Cryptography

- **Use Established Cryptographic Libraries**: Don't implement your own cryptographic algorithms.
- **Implement Strong Key Management**: Protect cryptographic keys from unauthorized access.
- **Use Appropriate Key Lengths**: Follow NIST guidelines for key lengths.
- **Use Modern Cryptographic Algorithms**: Avoid deprecated algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, DES.

## Error Handling and Logging

- **Don't Expose Sensitive Information**: Avoid revealing system details in error messages.
- **Implement Proper Logging**: Log security-relevant events but avoid logging sensitive data.
- **Handle Errors Securely**: Fail securely when errors occur.
- **Use Structured Exception Handling**: Catch and handle exceptions appropriately.

## Memory Management

- **Prevent Buffer Overflows**: Use languages with automatic memory management or bounds checking.
- **Avoid Dangerous Functions**: Replace unsafe functions with safer alternatives.
- **Validate Array Boundaries**: Check array bounds before accessing elements.
- **Release Resources Properly**: Free allocated memory and close file handles.

## Code Quality and Security Testing

- **Perform Static Analysis**: Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Conduct Regular Code Reviews**: Have peers review code for security issues.
- **Implement Security Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite.
- **Use Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Regularly scan code for known vulnerabilities.

## Secure Communications

- **Use TLS for All Communications**: Encrypt data in transit.
- **Validate Certificates**: Verify the validity of TLS certificates.
- **Implement Proper Certificate Validation**: Check certificate chains and revocation status.
- **Use Strong TLS Configurations**: Follow best practices for cipher suites and protocol versions.

## File Management

- **Validate File Uploads**: Check file types, sizes, and content.
- **Store Files Securely**: Use proper permissions and avoid directory traversal.
- **Sanitize File Names**: Remove or encode special characters in file names.
- **Limit File Operations**: Restrict file operations to designated directories.

## Database Security

- **Use Parameterized Queries**: Prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Apply Least Privilege**: Limit database account permissions.
- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Protect PII and other sensitive information.
- **Implement Connection Pooling**: Manage database connections efficiently.

## Local API Security

- **Authenticate and Authorize API Requests**: Implement proper authentication for local APIs.
- **Rate Limit API Calls**: Prevent abuse through rate limiting.
- **Validate API Input**: Apply the same validation rules as for applications.
