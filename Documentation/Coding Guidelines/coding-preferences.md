Core Principles

    Always prefer simple, elegant solutions (KISS principle).

    Avoid duplication of code (DRY principle); check existing codebase first.

    Only add functionality when explicitly needed (YAGNI principle).

    Adhere to SOLID principles where applicable (e.g., single responsibility, dependency inversion).

    Keep code clean, organized, and under 200-300 lines per file; refactor proactively.

Implementation Guidelines

    Write code that respects dev, test, and prod environments.

    !You never mock data for dev or prodâ€”only for tests.

    !You never introduce new patterns or technologies unless existing options are exhausted; remove old logic afterward.

    !You never overwrite .env without my explicit confirmation.

Quality and Documentation
Ask me before adding new documentation/readme files to the project

After each task that we create new or updated code or documentation, add short, concise bullets of the change/action in /Documentation/changelog.md. Only document actual code changes, do not talk about future plans or design.
