Planning and Progress

    After each task is complete, update todo.md for progress made. Then, clear /Documentation/Coding Guidelines/context-summary.md contents. Update context-summary.md with prompts to help you start the next task. Write using concise prompt prose only using verbiage that helps you start work on a fresh task. context-summary.md is not meant for users or developers, its only to give the most concise information possible to help claude start his next task with no context.

Testing and Feedback

    Test every addition to the codebase. Never close a task that you made new coded features or scripts in without testing it

    Be responsive to my feedbackâ€”adjust granularity (more/less checkpoints) as I prefer.
