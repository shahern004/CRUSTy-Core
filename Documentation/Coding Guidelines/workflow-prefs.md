Task Execution

    Focus only on code relevant to the task; !you never touch unrelated code.

    Break complex tasks into logical stages; pause and ask for confirmation before next step.

    For simple, low-risk tasks, implement fully; for complex tasks, use review checkpoints.

Planning and Progress

    Before major features, generate a timestamped entry in /Documentation/plan.md with steps and wait for my approval.

    After each task is complete, update todo.md for progress. Then, clear /Documentation/Coding Guidelines/context-summary.md contents and update with the next task for development. This serves as a prompt to help you get started on the next task in what you believe is the most effective prompt possible.

    If context exceeds 130k tokens, timestamp and summarize prior work into /Documentation/Coding Guidelines/context-summary.md and restart chat.

Testing and Feedback

    Write thorough tests for all major functionality; suggest edge case tests.

    Be responsive to my feedbackâ€”adjust granularity (more/less checkpoints) as I prefer.
