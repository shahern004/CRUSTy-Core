Planning and Progress

    After each task is complete, update the STM32H573I-DK_Migration_Roadmap.md document to reflect progress made by changing the status indicators (⬜ to ⏳ or ⏳ to ✅) as appropriate. The roadmap document serves as the central reference for tracking project progress and planning next steps. Before starting any new task, always check the roadmap document to understand the current state of the project and identify the next steps.

Testing and Feedback

    Test every addition to the codebase. Never close a task that you made new coded features or scripts in without testing it

    Be responsive to my feedback—adjust granularity (more/less checkpoints) as I prefer.
