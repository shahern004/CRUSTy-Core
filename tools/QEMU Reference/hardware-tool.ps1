.SYNOPSIS
    Simple script for building and flashing STM32H573I-DK applications to real hardware with logging.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script provides a simplified interface for building and flashing applications to real hardware
    with built-in logging to ensure output is captured for visibility.
    
    Note: This is a placeholder script for future implementation of hardware-specific functionality.

.PARAMETER BuildOnly
    If specified, only builds the application without flashing it.

.PARAMETER FlashOnly
    If specified, only flashes an existing binary without building it.

.PARAMETER BinaryPath
    Path to the binary file to flash to hardware. Required when FlashOnly is specified.

.EXAMPLE
    # Build and flash (default behavior)
    .\hardware-tool.ps1
    
.EXAMPLE
    # Only build the application
    .\hardware-tool.ps1 -BuildOnly
    
.EXAMPLE
    # Only flash an existing binary
    .\hardware-tool.ps1 -FlashOnly -BinaryPath "build\zephyr\zephyr.elf"
#>
