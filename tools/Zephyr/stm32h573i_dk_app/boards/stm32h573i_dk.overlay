 * ---------------------------------------
 * Hardware Security Feature Configuration
 * 
 * This overlay has been updated based on comprehensive verification of available
 * hardware security features on the STM32H573I-DK board. Only nodes that have been
 * verified to exist in the base devicetree and confirmed to work properly are enabled.
 * 
 * See Documentation/Embedded/STM32H573I_Security_Features.md for detailed information
 * on which hardware security features are available, which require software fallback
 * implementations, and performance comparisons between hardware and software.
